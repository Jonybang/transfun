Merging loops for speed in JavaScript

transfun is a JavaScript library that lets you write `map/filter/reduce` code that runs much faster than the equivalent native `map/filter/reduce code`.



Merging loops for speed

transfun automatically merges consecutive loops into one loop, then generates fast code for that loop (similar to stream fusion in â†’ Haskell).

Extensibility

A domain-specific language is used to define map/filter/reduce. With this language, library users can define other transformations: sum, and, or...

For the hurried ones

...you can jump directly to the speed results.
